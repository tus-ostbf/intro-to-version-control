# Introduction to Version Control Curriculum Module

This repository contains a collaborative, open‑source curriculum module for teaching Git and GitHub basics. It is designed for high‑school or introductory college‑level technology classes and can be adapted by educators worldwide.

## Module Structure

The curriculum is divided into four sequential lessons, each building on the previous one:

1. **Lesson 1: What is Version Control and Why Use It?**  
   Introduces the core concepts of version control, Git installation, and making your first commit.

2. **Lesson 2: Local Git – Repos, Commits, and History**  
   Dives deeper into staging, committing, viewing history, and reverting changes.

3. **Lesson 3: Remote Collaboration with GitHub**  
   Covers forking, cloning, pushing to remote repositories, and opening pull requests.

4. **Lesson 4: Final Project – Contribute to a Class Repo**  
   A hands‑on project where students apply the full Git/GitHub workflow in a simulated team environment.

Each lesson includes:
- A detailed lesson plan (`lesson-plan.md`) with timing, activities, and discussion prompts.
- A quick‑reference `README.md` with learning goals and prerequisites.
- Suggested assessment rubrics and additional resources.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

- Explain the purpose and benefits of version control.
- Install and configure Git on their local machine.
- Create and manage a local Git repository.
- Stage changes, commit with meaningful messages, and inspect commit history.
- Fork a repository, clone it locally, and push changes to GitHub.
- Collaborate using pull requests and resolve simple merge conflicts.
- Contribute to a shared repository following open‑source best practices.

## Target Audience

- Students with little or no prior experience with version control.
- Teachers, instructors, and workshop leaders looking for a ready‑to‑use, hands‑on curriculum.
- Self‑learners who want a structured introduction to Git and GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Basic computer literacy (creating folders, editing text files).
- A GitHub account (free tier).
- Git installed on the student’s machine (installation instructions are included in Lesson 1).
